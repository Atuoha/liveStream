MediaStreams API


The MediaStream interface represents a stream of media content. 
A stream consists of several tracks such as video or audio tracks. 
Each track is specified as an instance of MediaStreamTrack.
You can obtain a MediaStream object either by using the constructor or by calling MediaDevices.getUserMedia().
